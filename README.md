# Participatory-scrutnized-monitering
PSM-ML


this project is mainly to find the real time happening occurrences such as theft or some kind of abnormal activities that are happening in streets roads are some 
kind of public areas so that has to be taken care and even like vehicle theft thing all those like observe things that are happening in a public areas so which we 
can't stop at the beginning of it's happening so this psm it's been implemented to monitor the real time world and to take care 8 by second by second so that even
before other things are happening are about to happen or about to like get finished so we can get rid of it as soon as we can with all these kinds of necessary 
requirements

in this project virus image recognition and number plate detection for 2 basic needs so image recognition This is using RCNN model  is of finding any abnormal 
activities that are happening in streets like basically like theft killing a person carrying a gun something like that very of normal things so our image 
recognition will find all these kinds of images and then will reported to the nearby or respective stations or which are assigned to its machine pink to 
the machine and it will take care they will take care of it so that whenever the incident started it has been reported to its corresponding authority so that
even before completing the incidence the authority can come inside and take the necessary action maybe within minutes saudade incidence is about to happen is
stop at the beginning with this image recognition and basically number plate detection yes also done with Yolo 3 and her cascade classifier And we have a real
time database that are attached to our Raspberry systems so that if number plate detection is detected so it will automatically check to the respective database 
database and then will give us true or false whether this vehicle has been registered or not so if it is not registered your concern actions are taken so that 
if an unauthorised vehicle is entering in let's say particular area so it is about to happen for some other causes so so the authority whoever they are taking 
care can overcome this kind of issues so even if apologies tracking a car so they can real timely calculate like which area they have been passing it so individual
number plates even that is an advantage in this project so even by typing a number plate and cars number so they can track like which area they are being going
at a particular time second by second

mainly this project is being implemented only in real time so that we can stop immediately of happening all the unwanted or of things that are about to happen

we are happily about to inform that this project is being approved by Google and it was not developed by us but it was developed by some other colleagues in Google
so they are implementing these kinds of things in their real time kind of environment to come across these kinds of things with the same logics
